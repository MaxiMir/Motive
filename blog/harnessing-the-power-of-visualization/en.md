## 1. The science behind visualization

Visualization works by tapping into the power of your subconscious mind. When you create mental images of your goals, your brain interprets these images as if they were real experiences. This, in turn, triggers the release of specific neurotransmitters and hormones that help reinforce the neural pathways necessary for achieving your desired outcomes.

Numerous studies have shown that visualization can enhance performance in various fields, including sports, academics, and business. For instance, a study published in the _Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology_ found that athletes who practiced mental imagery experienced significant improvements in their performance.

- **Process Visualization**: focus on the steps and actions needed to reach your goal, such as practicing a skill, studying, or networking.
- **Guided Imagery**: this technique involves using pre-recorded scripts, music, or verbal cues to guide you through a visualization exercise.
